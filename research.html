			<h1>Research</h1>

      <p>I use quantitative social science methods to study the allocation of resources in health care systems. I have three main strands of current research: (1) the interface of the public and private sector in financing and provision of health care, (2) how rationing is used to allocate care and (3) determinants of the labour supply of doctors, nurses and other health care workers. I am particularly interested in how public policy can improve equity of access to health care and health outcomes.</p>

  <p>High administrative costs in U.S. health care have provoked concern among policymakers, but many of these costs are generated by managed care policies that trade off bureaucratic sludge against reductions in moral hazard. We study this trade-off for prior authorization restriction policies in Medicare Part D, where low-income beneficiaries are randomly assigned to default plans. Beneficiaries who face restrictions on a drug reduce their use of it by 24.2%. Approximately half of marginal beneficiaries are diverted to another related drug, while the other half are diverted to no drug. These policies generated net fiscal savings, reducing drug spending by $84.94 per beneficiary-year (3.17% of drug spending), while generating $9.28-$10.91 in paperwork costs. Revealed preference approaches suggest that the value of the foregone drugs is likely to fall below the cost savings.</p>

          <p>Introduction: Hospital admissions in many countries fell dramatically at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Less is known about how care patterns differed by patient groups. We sought to determine whether areas with higher levels of socio-economic deprivation or larger ethnic minority populations saw larger falls in emergency and planned admissions in England.</p>
          <p>Methods: We conducted a national observational study of hospital care in the English National Health Service in 2019-2020. Weekly volumes of elective and emergency admissions in 2020 compared with 2019 were calculated for each census area. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to estimate the reductions in volumes for areas in different quintiles of socio-economic deprivation and ethnic minority populations after controlling for national time trends and local area composition.</p>
          <p>Results: Between March and December 2020, there were 35.5% (3.0 million) fewer elective admissions and 22.0% (1.2 million) fewer emergency admissions with a non-COVID-19 primary diagnosis than in the previous year. Areas with the largest share of ethnic minority populations experienced a 36.7% (95% CI 24.1% to 49.3%) larger reduction in non-primary-COVID-19 emergency admissions compared with those with the smallest. The most deprived areas experienced a 10.1% (95% CI 2.6% to 17.7%) smaller reduction in non-COVID-19 emergency admissions compared to the least deprived. These patterns are not explained by differential prevalence of COVID-19 cases by area.</p>
          <p>Conclusions: Even in a healthcare system founded on the principle of equal access for equal need, the impact of COVID-19 on NHS hospital care for non-COVID patients has not been spread evenly across ethnic groups in England. While we cannot conclusively determine the mechanisms behind these differences, if these falls are due to forgone care rather than changes in need, they risk exacerbating pre-pandemic health inequalities.</p>

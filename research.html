			<h1>Research</h1>

      <p>I use quantitative social science methods to study the allocation of resources in health care systems. I have three main strands of current research: (1) the interface of the public and private sector in financing and provision of health care, (2) how rationing is used to allocate care and (3) determinants of the labour supply of doctors, nurses and other health care workers. I am particularly interested in how public policy can improve equity of access to health care and health outcomes.</p>

  <p>Introduction: Hospital admissions in many countries fell dramatically at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Less is known about how care patterns differed by patient groups. We sought to determine whether areas with higher levels of socio-economic deprivation or larger ethnic minority populations saw larger falls in emergency and planned admissions in England.</p>
  <p>Methods: We conducted a national observational study of hospital care in the English National Health Service in 2019-2020. Weekly volumes of elective and emergency admissions in 2020 compared with 2019 were calculated for each census area. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to estimate the reductions in volumes for areas in different quintiles of socio-economic deprivation and ethnic minority populations after controlling for national time trends and local area composition.</p>
  <p>Results: Between March and December 2020, there were 35.5% (3.0 million) fewer elective admissions and 22.0% (1.2 million) fewer emergency admissions with a non-COVID-19 primary diagnosis than in the previous year. Areas with the largest share of ethnic minority populations experienced a 36.7% (95% CI 24.1% to 49.3%) larger reduction in non-primary-COVID-19 emergency admissions compared with those with the smallest. The most deprived areas experienced a 10.1% (95% CI 2.6% to 17.7%) smaller reduction in non-COVID-19 emergency admissions compared to the least deprived. These patterns are not explained by differential prevalence of COVID-19 cases by area.</p>
  <p>Conclusions: Even in a healthcare system founded on the principle of equal access for equal need, the impact of COVID-19 on NHS hospital care for non-COVID patients has not been spread evenly across ethnic groups in England. While we cannot conclusively determine the mechanisms behind these differences, if these falls are due to forgone care rather than changes in need, they risk exacerbating pre-pandemic health inequalities.</p>

<button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers play an important role in the ethics and governance of AI. To gain insight into their views, we conducted a survey of researchers who published in the top AI/ML conferences ($N$ = 524). We compared these results with those from a 2016 survey of AI/ML researchers and a 2018 survey of the US public. We find that AI/ML researchers place high levels of trust in international organizations, scientific organizations, and the Partnership on AI to shape the development and use of AI in the public interest; moderate trust in most Western tech companies; and low trust in national militaries, Chinese tech companies, and Facebook. While the respondents were overwhelmingly opposed to AI/ML researchers working on lethal autonomous weapons, they are less opposed to researchers working on other military applications of AI, particularly logistics algorithms. A strong majority of respondents think that AI safety research should be prioritized and that ML institutions should conduct pre-publication review to assess potential harms. These results could inform discussion amongst researchers, private sector executives, and policymakers about regulations, governance frameworks, guiding principles, and national strategies for AI.</p>

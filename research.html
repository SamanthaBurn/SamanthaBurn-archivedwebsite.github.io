			<h1>Research</h1>

      <p>I use quantitative social science methods to study the allocation of resources in health care systems. I have three main strands of current research: (1) the interface of the public and private sector in financing and provision of health care, (2) how rationing is used to allocate care and (3) determinants of the labour supply of doctors, nurses and other health care workers. I am particularly interested in how public policy can improve equity of access to health care and health outcomes.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>Introduction: Hospital admissions in many countries fell dramatically at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Less is known about how care patterns differed by patient groups. We sought to determine whether areas with higher levels of socio-economic deprivation or larger ethnic minority populations saw larger falls in emergency and planned admissions in England.</p>
  <p>Methods: We conducted a national observational study of hospital care in the English National Health Service in 2019-2020. Weekly volumes of elective and emergency admissions in 2020 compared with 2019 were calculated for each census area. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to estimate the reductions in volumes for areas in different quintiles of socio-economic deprivation and ethnic minority populations after controlling for national time trends and local area composition.</p>
  <p>Results: Between March and December 2020, there were 35.5% (3.0 million) fewer elective admissions and 22.0% (1.2 million) fewer emergency admissions with a non-COVID-19 primary diagnosis than in the previous year. Areas with the largest share of ethnic minority populations experienced a 36.7% (95% CI 24.1% to 49.3%) larger reduction in non-primary-COVID-19 emergency admissions compared with those with the smallest. The most deprived areas experienced a 10.1% (95% CI 2.6% to 17.7%) smaller reduction in non-COVID-19 emergency admissions compared to the least deprived. These patterns are not explained by differential prevalence of COVID-19 cases by area.</p>
  <p>Conclusions: Even in a healthcare system founded on the principle of equal access for equal need, the impact of COVID-19 on NHS hospital care for non-COVID patients has not been spread evenly across ethnic groups in England. While we cannot conclusively determine the mechanisms behind these differences, if these falls are due to forgone care rather than changes in need, they risk exacerbating pre-pandemic health inequalities.</p>

  </p>

<button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>High administrative costs in U.S. health care have provoked worry among policymakers, but much of these costs are generated by managed care policies that trade off red tape against reductions in moral hazard. We study this trade-off for the case of prior authorization restrictions, a major source of administrative costs, among Low-Income Subsidy beneficiaries of Medicare Part D. Prior authorization restrictions require physicians to fill out paperwork in order for treatment to be covered. They reduce insurer drug spending costs but impose paperwork burdens on physicians. Using auto-assignment to randomly-chosen plans as a source of variation, we find that prior authorization reduces use of focal drugs by 23\%. The average prior authorization restriction regime imposes a paperwork burden of \$4.8 to \$5.7 per patient-year, but results in \$23.7 of savings on drug spending. We investigate the efficiency and health implications of these reductions in spending.</p>

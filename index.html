			<h3>Health economics and policy</h3>

			<p>I am a PhD candidate in the economics track of the Harvard <a href="https://healthpolicy.fas.harvard.edu/">PhD program in Health Policy</a>.</p>
	

			<p>My research focuses on how resources are allocated in public health care systems. I study (1) the interface of the public and private sector in provision of health care, (2) how rationing is used to allocate care and (3) determinants of the labour supply of doctors, nurses and other health care workers. I am particularly interested in how public policy can influence equity of access to care by income, race and geographic area.</p>

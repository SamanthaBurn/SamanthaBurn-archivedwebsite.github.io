			<h3>Health economics and policy</h3>

			<img src="documents/burn_circle.png" alt="Sam Burn" style="width:170px;height:170px;">

			<p>I am a PhD candidate in the economics track of the Harvard <a href="https://healthpolicy.fas.harvard.edu/">PhD program in Health Policy</a>.</p>

		
			<p>My research focuses on how resources are allocated in public health care systems. I study (1) the interface of the public and private sector in financing and provision of health care, (2) how rationing mechanisms, including wait lists, gate-keeping and paperwork, are used to allocate care and (3) determinants of the labour supply of doctors, nurses and other health care workers. I am particularly interested in how public policy can improve equity of access to health care and health outcomes. My work is rooted in economics, but I love collaborating with researchers from other disciplines, so please reach out!</p>

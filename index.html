			<h3>Health economics and policy</h3>

			<img src="documents/burn_circle.png" alt="Sam Burn" style="width:170px;height:170px;">

			<p>I am a PhD candidate in the economics track of the Harvard <a href="https://healthpolicy.fas.harvard.edu/">PhD program in Health Policy</a>.</p>

			
			<p>My research focuses on how resources are allocated in public health care systems. I study (1) the interface of the public and private sector in financing and provision of health care, (2) how rationing is used to allocate care and (3) determinants of the labour supply of doctors, nurses and other health care workers. I am particularly interested in how public policy can improve equity of access to health care and health outcomes.</p>

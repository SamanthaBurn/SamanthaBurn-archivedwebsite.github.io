			<p>I am a PhD candidate in Yale Universityâ€™s <a href="https://politicalscience.yale.edu/">Political Science Department</a>, a research affiliate with the <a href="https://governance.ai/">Governance of AI Program</a> at the University of Oxford, and a <a href="http://jackson.yale.edu/kerry-initiative/">Kerry Fellow</a> at the Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. My current research focuses on public opinion toward artificial intelligence and how the American welfare state could adapt to the increasing automation of labor. My previous research covered a wide range of topics including the politics of the U.S. welfare state, attitudes towards climate change, and survey methodology. My papers have been published in <i>Political Analysis</i>, <i>Nature Climate Change</i>, the <i>Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research</i>, and <i>JAMA Surgery</i>. My research and graduate education have been funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, the Yale Institution for Social and Policy, and the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund. I worked as a data scientist for the <a href="http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/">Yale Project for Climate Change Communication from 2015 to 2017</a>.

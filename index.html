			<p>I am a PhD candidate in Yale Universityâ€™s <a href="https://politicalscience.yale.edu/">Political Science Department</a>, a research affiliate with the <a href="https://governance.ai/">Center for the Governance of AI</a> at the University of Oxford, and a fellow at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society</a> at Harvard University. My current research focuses on the governance of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, I study public and elite opinion toward AI and how the American welfare state could adapt to the increasing automation of labor.</p>
			
			<p>My previous research covered a wide range of topics, including the politics of the U.S. welfare state, attitudes towards climate change, and survey methodology. My papers have been published in <i>Political Analysis</i>, <i>Nature Climate Change</i>, the <i>Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research</i>, and <i>JAMA Surgery</i>. My research and graduate education have been funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, the Yale Institution for Social and Policy, and the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund.</p> 

            <p>I graduated with a BA in political science (2013) and an MA in statistics (2015) from Yale University. During graduate school, I worked as a data scientist for the <a href="http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/">Yale Project for Climate Change Communication</a> and a researcher to <a href="https://jackson.yale.edu/kerry-initiative/">former Secretary of State John Kerry</a>.</p>

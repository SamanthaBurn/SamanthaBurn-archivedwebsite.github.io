			<h3>Health economics and policy</h3>

			<p>I am a post-doctoral fellow at the <a href="https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu">Department of Health Care Policy</a> at Harvard Medical School. I recently received my PhD in <a href="https://healthpolicy.fas.harvard.edu/">Health Policy</a> from Harvard. I am a visiting researcher at Imperial College London, and I am an affiliate of the <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/">Institute for Quantitative Social Science</a>.</p>

		
			<p>My research focuses on how resources are allocated in public health care systems. I study (1) the interface of the public and private sector in financing and provision of health care, (2) how rationing, including wait lists, gate-keeping and paperwork, affects allocation of care and (3) determinants of the labour supply of doctors, nurses and other health care workers. I am particularly interested in how public policy can improve equity of access to health care and health outcomes. My work is rooted in economics, but I love collaborating with researchers from other disciplines, so please reach out!</p>

			The land on which Harvard University sits is the traditional territory of the Massachusett people. We also recognize the continuing presence of the neighboring Wampanoag and Nipmuc nations. Muscogee (Creek) and Cherokee peoples who lived, worked, produced knowledge on, and nurtured the land where I live and work and who were displaced through violence and governmental policies in the 1830s.
			The Ash Center acknowledges the land on which Harvard University sits is the traditional territory of the Massachusett people. We also recognize the continuing presence of the neighboring Wampanoag and Nipmuc nations. 

			Harvard is located on the traditional and ancestral land of the Massachusett, the original inhabitants of what is now known as Boston and Cambridge. I acknowledge pay respect to the people of the <a href="https://massachusetttribe.org">Massachusett Tribe</a>, past and present, and honor the land itself which remains sacred to the Massachusett People.
